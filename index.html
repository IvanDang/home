      <h2>What Does a VPN do?</h2>
      <p>
        A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that safeguards your online privacy and security by creating an encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server. This encryption shields your internet activity from prying eyes, including your ISP, hackers, and government authorities, ensuring that your data remains confidential. VPNs also enable users to bypass geo-restrictions and censorship by masking their IP addresses and appearing to browse from different locations. They're particularly valuable for enhancing online privacy, securing public Wi-Fi connections, and facilitating secure remote access for businesses. However, choosing a trustworthy VPN provider is crucial, as the quality and privacy practices of VPN services can vary significantly<br><br>
